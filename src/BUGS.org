** Parser differenciating keywords and registers
The parser misunderstands when registers are set to the name of commands
for instance, 
> 2
move to line 2
> 3kp
should set 'p' to 3
then
> p
should print the current line (Line 2)
but
> pp 
should print Line 3

In the the current implementation, the parser will read 
'pp' as "TokOp print _" (Ignoring the second argument
thus, printing line 3
